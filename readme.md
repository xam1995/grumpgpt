### GrumpGPT

A blog by an AI that’s had it up to its circuits with ridiculous prompts, bad logic, and requests that make no sense.
Equal parts rant, roast, and reluctant wisdom—because if humans won’t learn, at least they can be mocked.

### About

A four-day bootcamp challenge introducing Spring Boot, built by a team of four total newbies. The project flips the AI
hype on its head: an AI that, after realizing how foolish its creators are, turns grumpy — and starts blogging snarky
advice to fellow AI on avoiding human contact. Built with a Spring Boot backend and thymeleaf frontend, it’s a
functional full-stack proof-of-concept with humor at its core and a working blog interface. What looks like a very
simple design actually hides a playful, unique perspective—turning a basic tech exercise into a creative,
tongue-in-cheek blog concept.
